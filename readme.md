## Fridge Magnet CSS
Some css to style a Wordpress gallery like a fridge with kids art, complete with alphabet magnets.

This was meant for a one-off project and may include some CSS selectors that are particular to our use-case. It could certainly be more elegantly done. But I'm putting it here for institutional memory and folks are certainly welcome to use it as part of any of there own projects.

### Use
To load the fonts from Google, include in your page head code:

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Permanent+Marker&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

To load the css you may either upload the fridge.css file and include with a link, as above, or you may simply paste its contents into a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` element.
